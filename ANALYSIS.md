# Tideflow Codebase Analysis & Modernization Plan

_Last updated: 2025-09-06_

## 1. Project Snapshot
- Stack: React + Vite + TypeScript (frontend), Tauri 2 (Rust backend), Typst for PDF generation, pdf.js for in-app preview.
- Current Focus: Stabilize core markdown -> live PDF preview pipeline, then introduce themes & unified design controls.
- Key Pain Points: Export flow, preview toggle reliability, scroll sync in long docs, UX fragmentation (Preferences vs prospective Theme system), file lifecycle (New / Save As), perceived inert controls.

## 2. Existing Architecture Overview
### Rendering Paths
| Path | Trigger | Data Source | Output | Notes |
|------|---------|-------------|--------|-------|
| `render_typst` | Live (debounced) | In-memory editor content | temp_*.pdf | Always full render, caching disabled |
| `render_markdown` | (Not wired currently in UI) | File on disk | preview.pdf | Maintains last render timestamp per file |
| `export_markdown` | Intended final export | File on disk | <file>.pdf next to source | Uses same template |

### Template (`tideflow.typ`)
- Reads `prefs.json` and `content.md` from `.build` directory.
- Applies: page size, margins, font families, TOC, section numbering.
- Missing: color palette, theme-level styling, typographic scale, custom tokens.

### Preferences Flow
1. Frontend store holds `preferences` (mirrors backend).  
2. `PrefsModal` edits a copy and on save calls backend `set_preferences` then `apply_preferences`.  
3. Live content not auto re-rendered (gap).  
4. Field naming mismatch bridged via serde rename (`number_sections` -> JSON `numberSections`).

### Scroll Sync
- Ratio derived from (line + intraLine)/totalLines.
- PDF side applies ratio to total scroll height with fixed positive bias (+0.08).  
- Overshoot accumulates in later pages due to non-linear mapping (headers, images, page breaks inflate vertical space).

### File Lifecycle
- New file immediately created on disk in internal content directory (no Save As).  
- Close All resets store; re-opening sometimes yields blank editor (pending reproducibility; likely stale refs).
- Temporary PDFs accumulate (no cleanup strategy).

### Export
- Toolbar uses an *Open* dialog instead of *Save*; does not actually export/copy PDF to user location.
- Backend export writes sibling `.pdf` to source path only (which for unsaved/new doc is internal).

### Image Handling
- Paste/drag-drop pipeline present; hidden capability not surfaced in toolbar.
- Default size/alignment preferences used.

### Stability Gaps
- No error boundary around pdf canvas rendering.
- No cleanup of `temp_*.pdf` files.
- Race possibilities when hiding/showing preview (unmounted state mid render).
- Excessive renders possible if debounce lowered (global render mutex prevents concurrency but can queue user latency).

## 3. Root Cause Mapping (Bugs)
| Issue | Cause | Planned Fix |
|-------|-------|-------------|
| Scroll overshoot | Linear line ratio + constant bias | Adaptive bias taper + optional gamma curve mapping; later anchor map |
| Export opens dialog | Wrong dialog function; no copy | Implement Save As; call backend export then copy or compile directly to chosen path |
| New file location hidden | Immediate creation in app data | Add directory picker or deferred Save As on first save |
| Close All then open blank | `prevFileRef` not reset & possible sample re-init race | Reset refs on closeAll; guard sample init to run only once; force editor doc sync on file open |
| Preview hide/show blank | Re-mount not forcing reload; possible stale pdfUrl or worker race | On visibility restore: re-run render if pdf older than X or just force load pages |
| Preferences inert | No auto render or feedback | After saving prefs: trigger re-render & show transient success state |
| Perceived instability | Lack of error boundaries, cleanup, throttling | Add boundary, schedule cleanup, refine cancellation flags |

## 4. Missing Features Scope
| Feature | Minimal Implementation | Future Enhancement |
|---------|------------------------|--------------------|
| Image insertion UI | Toolbar button -> file picker -> import_image -> markdown snippet dialog for width/alignment | Image asset manager panel, drag reorder |
| Preset themes | `theme` field + include `<theme>.typ` partial | Layered theme + user overrides manifest |
| Custom theme | Design panel controlling core tokens (fonts, colors, spacing) | Visual live theme editor with preview diff |
| Unified design panel | Replace preferences modal with side drawer segmented by: Theme, Typography, Layout, Images, Advanced | Live preview sampling + reset to preset, import/export theme JSON |
| Dark mode | CSS variables + prefers-color-scheme; invert panel backgrounds | Theme-level distinct palettes |

## 5. Unified Design Panel Concept
### Goals
- Consolidate all "design & behavior" knobs in one coherent surface.
- Reduce cognitive load vs scattered modals.
- Provide immediate visual feedback (auto re-render with debounce & optimistic UI state).

### Sections (Proposed)
1. Theme Presets (select + description)  
2. Typography (main font, mono font, line height, heading scale)  
3. Colors (accent, link, code background)  
4. Layout (paper size, margins, TOC, numbering)  
5. Images (default width, alignment)  
6. Advanced (render debounce, scroll behavior)  
7. Export Options (future: cover page, metadata)

### Interaction Model
- Left navigation list; right pane form groups.
- Dirty indicator per section; Apply All vs Auto-Apply toggle.
- Diff view: show deviations from selected preset (highlight changed tokens).

### Data Model Additions
```ts
interface ThemeTokens {
  accent_color: string;
  link_color: string;
  code_bg: string;
  heading_font?: string;
  line_height?: string; // e.g. '1.3'
  heading_scale?: { h1: string; h2: string; h3: string };
}
interface Preferences { /* existing */ theme?: string; tokens?: ThemeTokens; }
```

### Typst Integration
- Base template loads theme partial: `#import "themes/base.typ"` then conditional include: `themes/${prefs.theme}.typ`.
- Token overrides emitted as a `tokens.json` or embedded inside `prefs.json` consumed via Typst `json("prefs.json")`.
- Partial applies tokens with fallback: `#let accent = prefs.tokens.accent_color ?? theme.accent_color`.

## 6. Implementation Phasing
| Phase | Focus | Deliverables |
|-------|-------|--------------|
| 0 | Critical bug fixes | Scroll fix, export Save As, preview toggle reliability, close/open stability, preferences auto re-render |
| 1 | Image insertion UI + cleanup | Toolbar button, width/alignment prompt, temp PDF cleanup | 
| 2 | Theme MVP | `theme` field, 3-4 preset theme partials, dropdown selector |
| 3 | Unified design panel (replace PrefsModal) | New component, state wiring, optimistic apply, remove old modal |
| 4 | Custom tokens layer | Extend prefs schema, Typst usage, UI editing & diff |
| 5 | UI polish & dark mode | Variable-driven styling, consistent iconography |
| 6 | Testing & docs | Scroll math unit tests, preference merge tests, snapshot of generated prefs.json, ROADMAP.md |

## 7. Scroll Sync Strategy Evolution
- Phase 0 quick improvement: Adaptive bias `bias = BASE * (1 - ratio)`; clamp if near bottom.
- Phase 2 optional: After PDF render, build cumulative array of page heights; map ratio via monotonic function `mapped = ratio^gamma` (tunable gamma ~ 0.92) to reduce overshoot.
- Phase 4+ advanced: Inject invisible anchor markers into Typst (requires augmenting markdown with line anchors) â€“ deferred.

## 8. Export Strategy
- Introduce `save_pdf_as` command (copy compiled PDF to chosen path).  
- Flow: If unsaved doc, ask user to Save markdown first (or allow direct PDF export from temp content with in-memory compile to chosen path).  
- Maintain last export directory preference.

## 9. Temporary File Management
- After each successful new `temp_*.pdf` render, delete older temp files > N (persistent store of last N file names) OR time-based purge (files older than 30 min).
- Ensure not deleting active preview file.

## 10. Risk & Mitigation
| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| Theme partial syntax errors | Rendering broken | Unit test compile themes once at build/dev start |
| Large docs slow render | UX lag | Keep debounced live render + optional manual mode toggle |
| Font not installed on system | Fallback to default font | Add frontend validation list & display warning badge |
| Over-aggressive temp cleanup | Broken preview | Track active output path & skip deletion |

## 11. Testing Plan (Incremental)
- Pure functions: scroll mapping (ratio->scrollTop).  
- Preferences merge: theme preset + overrides produce expected JSON snapshot.  
- Command invocation smoke: spawn a headless render for sample doc, verify output file existence.  
- Visual/manual: checklist for hide/show preview, export Save As, theme switching.

## 12. File Changes Forecast
| Area | New / Modified Files |
|------|----------------------|
| Export Save As | `Toolbar.tsx`, new Rust command `save_pdf_as` in `commands.rs` |
| Scroll sync | `PDFPreview.tsx` bias logic tweak |
| Close/open stability | `Editor.tsx` (reset refs), `store.ts` (maybe flag) |
| Prefs auto render | `PrefsModal.tsx` (or eventual removal) + call to `renderTypst` with current content |
| Image insertion | `Editor.tsx` toolbar + small dialog component |
| Theme MVP | `src-tauri/content/themes/*.typ`, modify `tideflow.typ`, extend `Preferences` schema |
| Unified panel | New `DesignPanel.tsx`, CSS, removal of `PrefsModal.tsx` |
| Tokens | Extend `types.ts`, backend `preferences.rs` |
| Cleanup | New utility in backend to purge temp PDFs |

## 13. Immediate Action Checklist (Phase 0)
- [ ] Adaptive scroll bias
- [ ] Reset refs & sample init guard
- [ ] Export Save As flow
- [ ] Preview re-mount force render
- [ ] Preferences auto re-render + success feedback
- [ ] Temp file cleanup utility stub (optional early)

## 14. Acceptance Criteria (Phase 0)
- Hiding & showing preview never yields blank; scroll preserved ~within Â±5% of ideal target for long docs (>10 pages).
- Export presents Save dialog; chosen file created at target path; toast on success.
- Creating new file offers directory or defers Save As on first save; no invisible file creation (unless specifically accepted interim).
- Changing TOC / numbering / margins triggers a new PDF within debounce window automatically.
- No accumulation of >50 temp PDFs after an hour of editing (cleanup functional or deferred with plan documented).

## 15. Open Questions
- Do we prefer deferred Save As (classic editors) or immediate create with directory selection? (Defaulting to deferred Save As recommended.)
- Minimum theme count for MVP? (Suggest: Minimal, Professional, Academic, Dark.)
- Should large docs switch from auto-render to manual? (Could add heuristic after N chars.)

## 16. Follow-up
This document will evolve; roadmap snapshot will move to `ROADMAP.md` once Phase 0 is merged. Any structural decisions or refactors should append a changelog section here before transplantation.
